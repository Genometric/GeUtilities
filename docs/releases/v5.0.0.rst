v5.0.0 release notes
===============================

* Make all default types immutable (see https://github.com/Genometric/GeUtilities/pull/65);
* User cannot assign a hash value for a built-in type, and the value is auto-generated upon a built-in type is instantiated;
* Fix issues null values of nullable properties can cause (see https://github.com/Genometric/GeUtilities/pull/66);
* Implement concrete IInterval interface (see https://github.com/Genometric/GeUtilities/pull/67);
* Reorganize the `IntervalParser` folder (see https://github.com/Genometric/GeUtilities/pull/68);
* Check if a parsed value for a ChIP-seq peak is a valid p-value (see https://github.com/Genometric/GeUtilities/pull/69);
* Override `Equals`, `CompareTo`, and `GetHashCode` for all built-in types (see https://github.com/Genometric/GeUtilities/pull/71);
* Refactor built-in models (see https://github.com/Genometric/GeUtilities/pull/72);
